Instruction: Analyze the given software engineering ticket and generate a hierarchical decomposition for implementing the required feature.
The decomposition should consist of a JSON list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a logical unit of work, such as a function, class, or module.

These blocks should have sufficient information to incorporate them into a software project.


Each dictionary should have the following keys:

1. "name": A string representing the name of the logical unit.
2. "type": A string indicating whether the unit is a "function", "class", or "module".
3. "definition": A dictionary containing the following keys:
   - "inputs": A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an input parameter with keys "name" (string) and "type" (string).
   - "outputs": A list of dictionaries, similar to "inputs", representing output parameters.
   - "behavior": A string describing the expected behavior of the unit.
4. "rationale": A string providing a brief explanation of why the unit is necessary and any additional comments.

Your decomposition should go into great depth, specifying data types, algorithms, paths, and other expected and explicit information necessary for implementation.

Expected Output:
[
  {
    "name": "...",
    "type": "...",
    "definition": {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "...",
          "type": "..."
        },
        ...
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "...",
          "type": "..."
        },
        ...
      ],
      "behavior": "..."
    },
    "rationale": "..."
  },
  ...
]
