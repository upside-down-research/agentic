Instruction: Concisely make a program in the Go programming language building a webapp.

The webapp will be an implementation of the Andon light idea.

Notionally, the web app will have a list of "capabilities", and the ability to "RED LIGHT" any of the capability

The webapp should have the following features:
1. A web UI with a form that has a name of a capability, a flag that indicates "enable" or "disable" and a submit button.
2. An internal state that tracks the capabilities and their status.
3. An API that allows the user to programmatically change/query the status of the capabilities. This route will be:
     - GET /capability/{name}/state
     - POST /capability/{name}/state
   The structure of the JSON payload for the POST request should be:
   ```
   {
     "state": "enabled"
   }
   ```
   If State is "enable", the capability is enabled, if it is "disable", the capability is disabled.
4. The backend storage should be a list of files on the filesystem. Each capability should map to a file that contains the state of the capability.
   The file should be named after the capability name, and the content of the file should be the state of the capability.
   The path of the files should be /var/run/andon/{capability_name}.state

This should be done using the Go language only. It must be complete and correct.
